/// @brief The LoadGameCommand class is responsible for loading a game from an
/// .sgf file and starting a new game using the information in that file.
///
/// LoadGameCommand is executed asynchronously (unless the executor is another
/// asynchronous command).
///
/// The sequence of operations performed by LoadGameCommand is this:
/// - Submit the "loadsgf" GTP command to the GTP engine
/// - Query the GTP engine for the information that was stored in the .sgf file
///   and that is needed to start a new game (e.g. board size)
/// - Start a new game by executing a NewGameCommand instance
/// - Query the GTP engine for other information that was stored in the .sgf
///   file (handicap, komi, moves)
/// - Setup the game with the information gathered via GTP
/// - Make a backup
/// - Notify observers that a game has been loaded
/// - Trigger the computer player, if it is his turn to move, by executing a
///   ComputerPlayMoveCommand instance
///
/// @attention If the computer player is triggered, the calling thread must
/// survive long enough for ComputerPlayMoveCommand to complete, otherwise
/// the GTP client will be unable to deliver the GTP response and the
/// application will hang forever.
///
///
/// @par Files with illegal content
///
/// LoadGameCommand performs two kinds of sanitary checks for every move it
/// finds in the .sgf file:
/// - Is the move played by the expected player color?
/// - Is the move legal?
///
/// If any one of these checks fails, the entire load operation fails. A new
/// game is started nonetheless, to bring the app back into a defined state.
///
/// An exception that is raised while the moves in the .sgf file are replayed
/// is caught and handled. The result is the same as if one of the sanitary
/// checks had failed.
