/// @brief The NewGameCommand class is responsible for starting a new game
/// using the values currently stored in NewGameModel.
///
/// Starting a new game is a complex operation that can be broken down into
/// the following steps:
/// - Deallocate the old GoGame object (if it exists)
/// - Create a new GoGame object
/// - Set up the board in the GTP engine
/// - Set up handicap and komi
/// - Configure the GTP engine with settings obtained from a profile
/// - Trigger the computer player, if it is his turn to move, by executing a
///   ComputerPlayMoveCommand instance
///
/// A client may suppress some of these steps by clearing the corresponding
/// property flag before a NewGameCommand object is executed. A client may
/// suppress the creation of a new GoGame by initializing NewGameCommand with
/// a pre-fabricated GoGame object.
///
/// @attention If @e shouldTriggerComputerPlayer is true, the calling thread
/// must survive long enough for ComputerPlayMoveCommand to complete, otherwise
/// the GTP client will be unable to deliver the GTP response and the
/// application will hang forever.
