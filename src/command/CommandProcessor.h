// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The CommandProcessor class is responsible for executing commands
/// encapsulated by objects of type Command. It implements a part of the
/// Command Processor design pattern.
///
/// Clients invoke submitCommand:() to pass a command object to the command
/// processor. The command processor then executes the command by invoking the
/// object's doIt() method. Execution occurs synchronously or asynchronously
/// depending on whether the command object conforms to the AsynchronousCommand
/// protocol.
///
/// The command processor remembers commands that are undoable in a command
/// history. The history has no size limit. When a client invokes undoCommand(),
/// the command processor looks up the command in its history that was most
/// rececently executed, and invokes this command's undo() method. It then
/// forgets about the command, so that a subsequent invocation of undoCommand()
/// will undo the next command in the history.
///
///
/// @par Asynchronous command execution
///
/// If a command object conforms to the AsynchronousCommand protocol, the
/// command's doIt() or undo() methods are invoked in the context of a secondary
/// thread. Control returns immediately to the caller who invoked
/// submitCommand:() or undoCommand(). CommandProcessor displays an
/// MBProgressHUD while it executes the command, and feeds progress updates from
/// the command into the HUD. Progress updates are delivered via the
/// AsynchronousCommandDelegate protocol.
///
/// @see submitCommand:()
