/// @brief The NewGameController class is responsible for managing user
/// interaction on the "New Game" view.
///
/// The "New Game" view collects information from the user that is required to
/// start a new game. The view is a generic UITableView whose input elements
/// are created dynamically by NewGameController. The data for populating the
/// view is provided by NewGameModel. Any changes made by the user (even if
/// she does not start a new game) are immediately written back to NewGameModel
/// so that when the "New Game" view is displayed the next time it will have
/// the same choices as the last time.
///
/// NewGameController expects to be displayed modally by a navigation
/// controller. For this reason it populates its own navigation item with
/// controls that are then expected to be displayed in the navigation bar of
/// the parent navigation controller.
///
/// NewGameController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// informed of the result of data collection. For this to work, the delegate
/// must implement the protocol NewGameDelegate.
