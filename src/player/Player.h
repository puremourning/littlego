/// @brief The Player class collects data used to describe a Go player (e.g.
/// player name, whether the player is human or computer, etc.).
///
/// The difference between the Player and the GoPlayer class is that Player
/// refers to an @e identity, whereas GoPlayer refers to an anonymous black or
/// white player. GoPlayer can be configured with a reference to a Player
/// object, thus bringing the Player object's identity into the context of the
/// concrete GoGame that the GoPlayer instance is associated with.
///
/// If a Player object represents a computer player (i.e. isHuman() returns
/// false), the Player object has an associated collection of settings that
/// define the behaviour of the GTP engine while this Player participates in a
/// game. This collection of settings is called a "GTP engine profile". At
/// runtime the convenience method gtpEngineProfile() returns an object that
/// encapsulates the settings collection. The actual reference is stored in
/// the property @e gtpEngineProfileUUID, which is read from and written to the
/// user defaults system.
